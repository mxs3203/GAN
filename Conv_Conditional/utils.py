    Function for combining two vectors with shapes (n_samples, ?) and (n_samples, ?).
    Parameters:
      x: (n_samples, ?) the first vector.
        In this assignment, this will be the noise vector of shape (n_samples, z_dim),
        but you shouldn't need to know the second dimension's size.

        Once again, in this assignment this will be the one-hot class vector
        with the shape (n_samples, n_classes), but you shouldn't assume this in your code.

    Function for getting the size of the conditional input dimensions

        z_dim: the dimension of the noise vector, a scalar
        mnist_shape: the shape of each MNIST image as (C, W, H), which is (1, 28, 28)
